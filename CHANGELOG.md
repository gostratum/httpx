## [Unreleased]

### Removed
- **BREAKING:** Removed `SanitizeViper()` function - was added in v0.1.4 but never used externally
  - Modern replacement: Use `Config.Sanitize()` method instead
  - Eliminates last viper dependency from httpx module
  - Part of framework-wide viper elimination effort

## [0.2.0] - 2025-10-29

### Breaking Changes

- Removed `WithBasePath(path string)` option. Base path is now a configuration value (YAML / env), not a programmatic option.

### Migration Guide

- Principle: "Configuration for values, Options for code" â€” move simple scalar values to YAML/configx and keep programmatic options for Go functions/objects.
- Example: move `WithBasePath("/api/v1")` to YAML as `http.base_path` and keep `WithMiddleware(...)` as an option.

### Added

- Observability support and lifecycle management for the HTTP server (start/stop hooks, metrics/tracing integration). (commit: 5c74853)

### Changed

- Update configuration management to use YAML and `core/configx` (remove programmatic base path option). (commit: 5a11a47)
